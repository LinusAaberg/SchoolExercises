Exercise #2: Conditionals and Loops
The problems below are written so you can solve them by writing  your own methods/functions.


Part 1 - Focus on Conditionals

Problem 1 (Simple)
makeNegative: In this simple assignment you are given a number and you have to make it negative.
Note that the input can also be negative.

Sample:
makeNegative(6)   → - 6
makeNegative(10)  → - 10
makeNegative(-22) → - 22


Problem 2 (Simple)
thirdLength: You are given two angles (in degrees) of a triangle.
Write a function to return the 3rd. Note: Sum of angles of a triangle = 180.

Sample:
thirdLength(45,45)  →  90
thirdLength(60,60)  →  60
thirdLength(54,42)  →  84


Problem 3 (Medium)
setAlarm: Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters.
The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and false otherwise.
The second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation, and false otherwise.
The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation
(because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm).
It should return false otherwise.

Sample:
setAlarm(true, true)   →  false 
setAlarm(false, true)  →  false 
setAlarm(false, false) →  false 
setAlarm(true, false)  →  true


Problem 4 (Medium)
isDivisible: Create a function isDivisible(n, x, y) that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y.
All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

Sample:
isDivisible(3,1,3)     → true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
isDivisible(12,2,6)    → true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
isDivisible(100,5,3)   → false because 100 is not divisible by 3
isDivisible(12,7,5)    → false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5


Problem 5 (Challenging)
calculateRide: Think of the Voi scooters available around you, which provide fun rides at reasonable prices.
You have to calculate the fare of one ride given 3 parameters: Distance travelled in kilometers,
charging done or not, and membership type. For distance, the calculation goes like this:

Distance
<5 Km – 20 Sek per Km
5 Km -15 Km – 15 Sek per Km
>15 Km – 8 Sek per Km
	Charging done
False → No discount
True → Fare = Fare – 25% Fare

Membership
None – Fare
Silver – 90% Fare
Gold –  80% Fare
Platinum – 65 % Fare

Sample:
calculateRide(10,true,gold)
10 * 15 = 150 Sek
Charging done →  150 – 38.5 = 111.5
Gold Membership = 89.2 Sek
Output = 89.2
	

Part 2 - Conditionals and Loops

Problem 6 (Interactive quiz)
Write an interactive quiz. It should ask the user three multiple-choice or true/false questions about something.
It must keep track of how many they get right, and print out a "score" at the end.

Sample:
Are you ready for a quiz? Y  
Okay, here it comes!

Q1) What is the capital of Albania?
        1) Sofia
        2) Tirana
        3) Budapest  
2

That's right!

Q2) Can you store the value "dog" in a variable of type int?
        1) yes
        2) no
1

Sorry, "dog" is a string. ints can only store numbers.

Q3) What is the result of 6+4/2?
        1) 5
        2) 8
        3) 4
2

That's correct!

Thanks for playing!


Problem 7 (Use the && , || and ^ operators)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and determines whether it is divisible by 5 and 6,
whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, and whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, but not both.

Here is a sample run of this program:
Enter an integer: 10
Is 10 divisible by 5 and 6? false
Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6? true
Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6, but not both? true


Problem 8 (Game: pick a card)
Write a program that simulates picking a (random) card from a deck  of 52 cards.
Your program should display the rank ( Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King ) and suit
( Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) of the card.

Here is a sample run of the program:
The card you picked is Jack of Hearts


Problem 9 (Business: check ISBN-10)
An ISBN-10 (International Standard Book Number) consists of 10 digits:
 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 d9 d10. The last digit, d10, is a checksum,
which is calculated from the other nine digits using the following formula:

(d1 * 1 + d2 * 2 + d3 * 3 + d4 * 4 + d5 * 5 + d6 * 6 + d7 * 7 + d8 * 8 + d9 * 9) % 11

If the checksum is 10, the last digit is denoted as X according to the ISBN-10 convention.
 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the first 9 digits and displays the 10-digit ISBN (including leading zeros).
Your program should read the input as an integer.

Here are 2 sample runs:
Enter the first 9 digits of an ISBN as integer: 013601267
The ISBN-10 number is 0136012671
	Enter the first 9 digits of an ISBN as integer: 013031997
The ISBN-10 number is 013031997X
	Problem 5 (Find the smallest n such that n^2 > 12000)
Use a while loop to find the smallest integer n such that n^2 (n square) is greater than 12000.


Problem 10 (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average of
the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display
the average as a real number. 

Here is a sample run:
Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0
The number of positives is 3
The number of negatives is 1
The total is 5.0
The average is 1.25


Problem  11 (Binary representation)
Write a program that asks for a positive integer until the uses enters one,
and calculates the binary representation of that integer. Hint: Use the modulo operator %

Sample:
Enter a positive integer: -3
Enter a positive integer: -88
Enter a positive integer: 8
The binary representation of 8 is 1000


Problem 12 (Reverse a string)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and displays the string in reverse order.

Sample run:
Enter a string: ABCD
The reversed string is DCBA


Problem 13 (Find the factors of an integer)
Write a program that reads an integer and displays all its smallest factors in increasing order.
For example, if the input integer is 120, the output should be as follows: 2, 2, 2, 3, 5.


Problem 14 (Best student)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students and each student's name and score,
and finally displays the name of the student with the highest score.


Problem 15 (Random month)
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 1 and 12 and displays the English month name
January, February, ..., December for the number 1, 2, ..., 12, accordingly.

Problem 16 (Display pyramid)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer from 1 to 15 and displays a pyramid,
as shown in the following sample run:

Enter the number of lines: 5
1
2 1 2
3 2 1 2 3
4 3 4 1 2 3 4
5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5
